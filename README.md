# PRODIGY_CS_01
Caeser Cipherr Encryption Tool is an ancient method of encryption used by caeser cipherr of the rome to send secret messages, In this simple project of mine i have implemented caeser cipherr encryption using CLI.


# Working 
  1.Takes input message from the user and asks for no of shifts.
	2.Example lets say 'hi' the program would find the index of h in the list of keys which would be used to encrypt 
     the message 
  3.upon capturing the index of each letter in the message 'hi' in our case the program will make shifts subjected 
     to the shift_amount provided

  
# How To Use 
1. User wll be welcomed with a ascii art upon which user has to make a choice whether he/she has to encrypt or decrypt.
2. Upon which user will be prompted to input their message.
3. User will be asked to input the Sift_amount or no os shift they would like to have.
4. encryption/decryption message will be displayed with appropriate follow up prompt.


# Note
Encyrption/Decryption will only work seamlessly on the messages that were or going to be encrypted/decrypted using this program. 
The Encryption total relies on the keys in the program enlisted therefore this tool might not be able to encode/decode as expected unless the other version also have the same list of keys.
